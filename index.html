<div class="bold">COMMUNICATION WITH CUSTOMERS</div>
First and foremost, technology affects a firm’s ability to communicate with customers.
In today’s busy business environment, it is necessary for employees to interact with clients quickly and clearly.
Websites allow customers to find answers to their questions after hours. Fast shipment options allow businesses to move products over a large geographic area. 
When customers use technology to interact with a business, the business benefits because better communication creates a stronger public image.

<div class="bold">EFFICIENCY OF OPERATIONS</div>
Technology also helps a business understand its cash flow needs and preserve precious resources 
such as time and physical space. Warehouse inventory technologies let business owners understand 
how best to manage the storage costs of holding a product. With proper technology in place, executives can save time and 
money by holding meetings over the Internet instead of at corporate headquarters.

<div class="bold">BUSINESS CULTURE AND CLASS RELATIONS</div> 
Technology creates a team dynamic within a business because employees at different locations have better interactions. 
If factory managers can communicate with shipment coordinators at a different location, tensions and distrust are less likely to evolve. 
Cliques and social tensions can become a nightmare for a business; technology often helps workers put their different backgrounds aside.

<div class="bold">SECURITY</div>
Most businesses of the modern era are subject to security threats and vandalism. 
Technology can be used to protect financial data, confidential executive decisions and other proprietary information that leads to competitive 
advantages. Simply put, technology helps businesses keep their ideas away from their competition. By having computers with passwords, a business 
can ensure none of its forthcoming projects will be copied by the competition.

<div class="bold">RESEARCH CAPACITY</div>
A business that has the technological capacity to research new opportunities will stay a step ahead of its competition. For a business to survive, 
it must grow and acquire new opportunities. The Internet allows a business to virtually travel into new markets without the cost of an executive jet 
or the risks of creating a factory abroad.
